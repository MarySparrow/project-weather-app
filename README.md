# Weather App

This project's goal is to build a simple weather web app that shows today's weather and temperature, and a 5-day forecast using the Open Weather API ðŸŒ¤

## The problem

We have used JavScript's fetch() method to get all the data we need from the Open Weather API ðŸŒ¦ This is our first time working with an API, so we learned about understanding its documentation and the different parameters in its URL.
Learned about promises and how to extract the data from JSON object ðŸ’ª
We also learned about styling in javascript and dared to try animation effects for the icons and background.

If we had more time we would have gotten more into how to do geolocation. 
We have a question: How can we style the icons fetch from the API so that they are responsive? We have tried giving them an class and styling them directly on css and we also tried in the image tag in Javascript, but that didn't work, so we ended up giving them a fixed height. How do we make it work and how can we write it correctly on the media queries?
